        <p class="font"> <strong> Hi There!
        Welcome to my site. My name is Jay Mark D. Gutierrez.</strong>  <br/><br/>I am a self taught programmer with keen interest in automation, making user
        interfaces, web development and working with databases. Most of my knowledge
        comes from online and it is more than fine for me since I am persistent in 
        knowing and familiarizing the things I have to for the job. Being a techy person,
        I am quite intrigue with technology. I love to learn new stuffs related to the 
        internet. Whether it be making websites, automating stuffs like logins, uploads, 
        downloads, saving data and the likes, I push to see what more I can harness within
        me. I take note of the resources I have came across with. I wonder how I may be able 
        to use them in the future. Resourcefulness is one of the many traits I value. With
        common sites like google and youtube, I see to it I learn something new everyday.
        With the evolving and changing pace of technology, I can say there is a lot to 
        learn into.
        <br/>
        <br/>I am a professional
        in the field of engineering. I am an electrical engineer to be precise with at leasy 8 years 
        of working experience. With that being said, I've grown to gain the discipline
        pertaining to the work environment. Along with this comes the insights with 
        what it's like working with a variety of people either those above me, under or
        quite the same rank as mine. I am currently working in a power plant here in my 
        home country the Philippines. It has been many yeas now since I got first employed.
        Though I see it okay with my current employment right now, I am seeking new
        opportunities where I can grow and nurture new skills especially in the filed
        of programming.
        <br/>
        <br/> 
        I am optimistic in gaining relative experience when it comes to the tech industry.
        There is great potential in is as everyone got to connect with ease thanks to its
        network. I am eager to pursue and create codes which saves time for many individuals.
        What can be done in an hour manually may just be half of that if associated with the
        right program. I see it beneficial not only in my past but also for othersif i can aid 
        them in fulfilling tasks the automated way. Some supervision may still be needed but
        efficieny is raised on most occassions. I like to solve problems and welcome new
        challenges that come my way. They serve as stepping stones which would help me master
        whatever task I may be doing for the moment.
        <br/>
        <br/> I see programming as something I can be passionate about. If I'd known 
        about it sooner, I would have started to learn back then. None of those close
        to me aren't involved in such apparently so it took me a while to discover.
        The potential on it is surely immense. When I can't code due to work, I scan 
        related videos especially at youtube. If I can't do the technical of physically 
        coding, I pursue to get some inspirational stuffs from those whom I can look
        up to. It's amazing to glimpse in their perspective. The term overwhelming 
        is a good fit on what an impact programming has for many and so, It is only
        justified I invest in myself by being acquainted with this industry.
